# Julia Function Missing Return Value

This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia: a function missing a return value for a specific case. The function `myfunction` is defined to return the square of its input if the input is positive and the negative of its square if the input is negative. However, it doesn't specify what to return if the input is 0, resulting in an error.
